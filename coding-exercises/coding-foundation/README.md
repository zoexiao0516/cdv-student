# ðŸ‘¾ CDV Coding Exercise 1 ~ Foundation

#### Difficulty:
I was stuck by how to clear all the squares created, and it turned out the problem could be easily solved by adding a single line of code `parentElement.innerHTML="";` (credits to Tom Zhu).

#### Keywords:
`getElementById`, `createElement`, `appendChild`, `flexbox`, `for-loop`, `addEventListener`, `function`, `hover`

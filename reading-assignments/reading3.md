#### Response
*Surveillance Capitalism* talks about the surveillance capitalists, like tech giants Google and Facebook, using the asymmetries of knowledge to spy on "users", exploit personal data, and then make a profit out of it. 

In spite of the discussion that internet users opting to concede our privacy in exchange for increased connection and convenience has been on for a few years, I found that the trend of growing dependence on these data-extracting apps has been seemingly unstoppable since smartphones came around. Therefore, I think it is an amazing thing what professor Shoshana Zuboff is doing to keep more people informed of the manipulative action surveillance capitalists are doing behind our backs. 

Not so long ago, I also realized my personal preference was totally read through by surveillance technologies. I did nearly all my daily shoppings on Taobao and Hema, both are e-commerce platforms offered by Alibaba. So they have every access to know my shopping habits. And one day during the vacation, my mom asked me to buy something on sale for her on Taobao, first of all, I could not even find this product in Taobao’s on-sale section (but totally different stuff which Taobao thinks I would like with a higher price range). And later when I used the link my mom shared to open the shopping window of the product, it was not “on sale” at all for me. That’s when I feel “targeted” by the system. My dad can buy that product and all of my mom’s colleagues could do the same thing, but I couldn’t because they know I have different shopping habits.

The main thing professor Shoshana Zuboff studies in her book is the business model for surveillance capitalism. While I agree that there are inequalities in asymmetries of knowledge and that it has real, dangerous ramifications for the economy, and democracy as a whole, I am not a fan when an intellectual pointing out problems but not talking about the solutions or just covering it up with some big, vague words, like democracy. And when professor Shoshana Zuboff put hopes in young generations to turn the tide toward surveillance capitalism back around, I think she is being too optimistic. It is not impossible, but not promising to expect a revolution when a generation is born with this surveillance technologies around. While surveillance technologies are the new weapons capitalists take to accumulate greater wealth, the nature of professor Shoshana Zuboff’s critique of surveillance capitalism is actually a critique of capitalism.

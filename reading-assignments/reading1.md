### Response

#### Why is **"context"** of data important?
Even for the smallest project, how the dataset is collected and the information included is crucial for reading the result and interpretation, not to mention dealing with Big Data where data cleaning process is complex. I see Big Data as a library, but an unorganized one. It contains data not like those we can see every day, and it's not readable like a histogram or a pie chart, not even straightforward to those who manages the databases.

Data interpretation should not be based on numbers but the story behind the data. Data without its context is first of all, incomplete, and also hard to interpret, and thus became inaccurate and misleading. Those who can make great use of Big Data are those who have complete access to it. In China, two giant tech companies Tencent and Alibaba almost have complete information about every netizen. Taobao could read my browsing history on websites more than itself and recommend the products that I may not know I need. The private conversation we have every day may also be eavesdropped on by Siri, and now it’s those tech companies’ right to decide whether they want to make a profit out of it.

#### Working with (big) data
Both articles point out that Big Data has been dominated by those with computational power, but if we want more people empowered by Big Data, changes in practices and mentality should be made. If I type Big Data in the search box, most of the items listed are about how to analyze the data with analytical tools, but not on a humanistic point of view that how can human really benefit from Big Data.

A common question both articles raised is "How can the data be translated into knowledge, behavior, and people?" More importantly, how can data be used other than a commodity? The first article introduces some of the negative implications and challenges when working with Big Data, it works as an alert to notify us the mishaps we could encounter when we deal with data; while in the second article, Giorgia claims data visualization will inevitably be all about personalization so that we can eventually return data from people back to people.

I also see Big Data as a pool, with data “voluntarily” donated by people. But this volunteering is also kind of compulsory because users have to trade with their personal data for quality online service. And people sure have shown the adaptability to the new normality. Most of the time, when people talked about the massive amount of public data that they can “freely” access via the Internet, they’re like treasure hunters who have finally dug something that belonged to them. While the identity of a treasure hunter entitles them to explore, they are also being dug.

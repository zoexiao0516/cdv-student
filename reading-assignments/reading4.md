#### Assignment

1. Take notes while you are reading and listening to the material above.
2. Think of contemporary systems/applications in which data is used to predict the future in order to then act upon it. Compile a list of 3 such situations that come to your mind and describe them briefly.
3. Collect your thoughts on *Prediction* and its role in the three above sources. Formulate a short response (250-400 words). Your associations, opinions and ideas may (not obligatory) be complemented by reflections on
  - "collective average vs individual fate",
  - "statistic vs. algorithmic prediction" or
  - "social physics"


#### Response
We are all too invested in predicting our future. Since ancient times, we have prophets, then we have astrologists, now we have statistics and powerful computers. In PKD’s story, precogs or idiots tell authorities the future. Humans are so into precognition, but in this story, PKD tells that “as soon as precognitive information is obtained, it cancels itself out ”. The prediction will only be validated in one scenario, that is, the people involved prediction don’t know what will happen. That’s the only way to know whether the prediction is accurate or not, which means, prediction can never be used on ourselves, but only on others. Therefore, perhaps the most successful algorithm is Amazon’s recommendation algorithms. It’s harmless, we provide customers with a larger scale showcase. The best purchase one could probably have made is after seeing more options and comparing them. It’s closer to how the human brain works. But other algorithms may not be as instinctive, and people are naturally terrified by the things they cannot understand and demonize them.

In today’s world, we largely exploit machine learning algorithms to predict that so-called future. Here’s the problem, are we anticipating the future or are we creating the future? And the three idiots are reminiscent of how we divide our data set in machine learning algorithms: training set, testing set, and validation set. 

Making predictions is what all machine learning algorithms do. But what is machine learning? One definition is that “machine learning is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to ‘learn’ with data, without being explicitly programmed”. The nature of machine learning is that, with the massive computational power available, we can apply statistical theories on datasets large enough to tells us patterns. I think it’s not dangerous but rather hopeful to say that “the mathematical analysis has finally been applied in earnest to the messy and unpredictable realm of human behavior.” And I really do like the idea of “social physics”. I like how it connects social behavior with nature. I feel assured when there is a universality to be found in human characters. Because back then, you can never say you can read a person like a book. But we can now. And also like the story in the podcast, police had to report the crime rate in the district on their duty, they would inevitably cheat with data to keep the job. But I don’t see why that the issue brought by the system. On the contrary, human insecurity is what is wrong here. Without the system, there would still be much trouble, and maybe the worse ones.

I major in Data Science. Bias and variance are literally everything I’m learning and dealing with all day. Data scientists are trying to increase prediction accuracy all the time. Everyone knows big data is powerful and changes the way we make business decisions, validate research results, and fight crimes. At the same time, we are also worried about an analysis based on big data is at the cost of individual uncertainty. But what statistics and computers generate are the probabilities of the incidents. The help of computers does not mean the elimination of human intervention. Yes, we can’t speak with certainty about the individual, and we won’t.

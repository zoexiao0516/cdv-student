# 🌧 Coding Exercise 6 (Mastering Transition)

🔗 See my work [here](https://zoexiao0516.github.io/cdv-student/lab/lab7+ex6-transition/index.html).

✏️ The last function is for highlighting the bar with the maximum value. It will come in handy when there is a huge number of bars~

😄 I made sure that every emoji I use is compatible in Chrome~

### 🤦🏻‍♀️ Difficulty 
- Fading out the bars that will be removed 

    Solution: create rectangle ➡️ set to height 0 ➡️ remove

- remove and add elements is messy~ can't really describe what was going on

    Solution: **assign key** to the updating data 

- If I click the button too fast, the bars will lag...

    Solution: I simply delete the delay() time and shorten the duration() time, and it worked!

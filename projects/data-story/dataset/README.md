# üç± Datasets Pickle
### [Mental Health in the Tech Industry](https://www.kaggle.com/anth7310/mental-health-in-the-tech-industry)

This data is from Open Source Mental Illness (OSMI) using survey data from years 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. Each survey measures and attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace. 

First of all, the stress levels among my peer are skyrocketing... I hear people talk about their anxieties all the time but they are hard to quantify or even measure. This dataset provides a nice way out. 

*Collecting a similar dataset on students around campus may be a fun thing to do, I wish I thought about that before the data zine project ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.  

Moreover, as a STEM student, it would be nice to know more about how are the grownups doing at work.

### [The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) Collection](https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection) and [M+](https://github.com/mplusmuseum/collection-data)

MoMA is committed to helping everyone understand, enjoy, and use modern art collection. The Museum‚Äôs website features 89,695 artworks from 26,494 artists. This research dataset contains 138,151 records, representing all of the works that have been accessioned into MoMA‚Äôs collection and cataloged in our database. It includes basic metadata for each work, including title, artist, date made, medium, dimensions, and date acquired by the Museum.

M+ is building a collection of twentieth and twenty-first century visual culture, encompassing the disciplines of design and architecture, moving image, and visual art, grounded in Hong Kong with a global perspective. Geographically, the collections cover Hong Kong, mainland China, and regions across Asia and beyond. The M+ Collections are composed of the M+ Collection, the M+ Sigg Collection, and the M+ Collection Archives.

I picked these two datasets on museums because I recently worked on a project about museums. By digging into these datasets, I can learn about what's in museums and how people usually study them.

### [Earthquakes from the USGS API geojson to csv (Updated monthly)](https://www.kaggle.com/itokianarafidinarivo/earthquakes-monthly-usgs-updated-monthly), [Significant Earthquakes, 1965-2016 with Date, time, and location](https://www.kaggle.com/usgs/earthquake-database), and [Earthquake Worry?](https://www.kaggle.com/codebreaker619/earthquake-worry)

Here are two datasets about significant earthquakes around the world, and one dataset about people's reaction to this natural disaster.

I want to dive into these datasets because I want to work on some earthquake prediction algorithms. And to create a data viz is one great strategy to find patterns.

            <div class="title">Men still dominate the data science world</div>
            We see more gender disparities in the STEM fields. This should not come as a surprise, but the data science world, like the rest of the tech world, has a heavy gender imbalance, as 79% identify as men, 19% identify as women, and 2% identify as others.<br><br>
            <div class="note">* There are 20,036 respondents to the survey.</div>
            <div class="note">* Others include "Prefer not to say", "Prefer to self-describe", "Nonbinary"</div>

            <div class="title">The gender gap in all earnings</div>
           In each range of salary, men are payed higher. But this is an overall comparison of payment disparity. Why is there such big difference among different gender types?

          <section class="step">
            Will education, job title, and experience change the situation? In the following interactive graph, we will focus on breaking down salaries for different genders by various factors, such as the ones mentioned previously, in the quest of interpreting the gender gap.

            <div class="title">Will it change?</div>
            We can see the gap minizes/differs with different balues on X-axis.

            Intead of just showing the average coding experience of professionals in each field, it might be more suitable to see a heatmap of their coding experience against their age, so that it also accounts for the experience they gained during the course of their career. This shows how experienced individuals are at particular age groups in the field.

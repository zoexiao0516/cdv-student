                <h1>things i wish i knew before studying data science</h1>
                <p>Hi, I'm Zoe. A college student trying very hard to get a data science degree.</p>
                
                <p>Ever since a Harvard Business Review suggested that 'data scientist' is the 'sexiest job of the 21st Century', many people (including myself) want to break into the data science field. But as a student, I wish I could know more about what a career path in DS would look like and what are the exciting jobs out there. </p>

                <p>So let's listen to the voices of data professionals from Kaggle! This data visualization of <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2020/data">2020 Kaggle Data Science & Machine Learning Survey</a> will take you on a journey through all of the different job titles in the DS fields, and compare salary, how many women are in this field, day-to-day roles, and other factors. </p>
                    
                <p><strong>Scroll to start</strong> (If the visualisation doesn't fit your screen, try zooming out)</p>

                <p>In this visualization, I choose a sample of 200 data professionals from the dataset, with job titles ranging from engineer, analyst to product manager (<strong>hover on the small dots to see more details</strong>) </p>
                
            </section>
            <section class="step">
                <p>
                    First let's see what are the most popular jobs in data science.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    About 1/4 of data professionals write down their job title as data scientist, followed by software engineer and data analyst.
                </p>
                <p>
                    *A side note: because data science is a fairly new field, the definitions of different job titles are quite loose or fluid. For instance, many data scientists are actually software engineers as well. 
                </p>

                <svg id = 'legend2' width = '400px' height = '550px'></svg><br><br>
                Now let's see the most exciting number - salary! We can see the individual salary as well as the median salary for each job title on the labels. Hover on the label if you forget the name!

                <h2>What are the activities that make up an important part of these roles?</h2>

                <p>
                    Data scientists have a vareity of data roles. To become a data scientist, you have to be versatile: you use a bunch of tools in computer science and programming, math statistics as well as general scientific insights and methods in order to extract insights from data and then using those insights to drive impact in both business and products. 
                <br><br>
                    If you're a data lover and would like to use data to solve problems, you're likely to fit into any positions.

                <h2>Gender disparities in Data Science</h2>
                Less than 1/5 of data professionals are female and nonbinary. Yes, data science, like anywhere else in STEM, is still a male dominated world. 
                <br><br>
                However, during my earlier explorative data analysis on this dataset, I found out that the women ratio in data science students are a lot higher. We should really hold high hopes for the future of gender equality in DS!
            </section>
            <section class="step">
                <h2>Will education ease the gender gap?</h2>
                So we've seen the salary and women ratio separately before. But will education help women reach higher goals?  
                <br><br>
                It seems that women tend to opt for longer education periods, having a bigger representation in classes such as Master's degree and Doctoral degree. And we see there are women who are paid almost as high as men when they invsest in higher education.

                    *Disclaimer: Keep in mind while going through this visualization that over 20,000 kagglers responded to this survey, but only half of them are data professionals. Despite it still looking like a big number, no "certain" conclusion can be inferred from this data.

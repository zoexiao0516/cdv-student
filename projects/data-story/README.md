### 🥸 Intro
So you've decided to study data science and break into the DS field, let's listen to the voices of data professionals/Kagglers! This data visualization of [2020 Kaggle Data Science & Machine Learning Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/neomatrix369/kaggle-machine-learning-data-science-survey-ext) will take you on a journey through all of the different job titles in the DS fields, and compare salary, how many women are in this field, day-to-day roles, and other factors.

### 🙇🏻‍♀️ Process
**Why this dataset and this viz?** <br>
I'm a college student trying very hard to get a data science degree and constanly worrying about my future and what things I can look forward to in the future workplace. So when I came across this dataset on Kaggle, I want to dive deeper into this survey results and see what I can learn from the working professionals. On one hand, because Kaggle is the most popular online data science community, an on the other, I think many other people would like to see this dataset being explored in a live website. d3 makes visualizing data points easy and interesting, and there are visual impacts and storytelling power that could not be achieved by simple bar chart or statistics. 

**What can we see in the viz?** <br>
This is a scrolling based data visualization, and in the left part I put down the context for the data viz. I rearrange the data points in different graphs to show their job titles, salary levels, women ratio, roles, etc., and the transition among different graphs is smooth. Besides, we can always see details of each data point by hovering.

**Compromises** <br>
The greatest compromise I made is that I chose only a sample of 200 data points from the dataset to visualize, otherwise it will not be friendly for transitions and simulations. But I think the 200 sample does enough job for visual impacts and representing the whole dataset fairly.

[The historical cost of light](https://pudding.cool/2020/12/lighting-cost/)

This article is an amazing visualziation of how expensive artificial light was. By scrolling down this webpage, we are "working" to earn the light. There is a clear contrast between nowadays and hundreds of years ago. When we are scrolling, we are also entertained by some brief historical facts. Keeping scrolling down the page does feel like a labor to me. 

[What Airport Traffic Tells Us About the World's Megacities](https://pudding.cool/2018/07/airports/)

This artcile reveals a startling inequality in global economy. By comparing the fights in and out the world's megacities, we can spot several unusual data points derived from African cities. The number of fights is not correlated with the population growth in cities, which tells us that these cities are growing due to unsustainable rural living conditions, climate change, and war. People are moving out of necessity rather than opportunity.

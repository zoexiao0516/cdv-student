# Data Zine Project

#### Inspirations
[Dear Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PTTTbewj2zsqgztBhNZKB2ipunpI7jiok2tmm_kfhXE/edit#gid=0) by Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec<br/>

[Pie Multiples with Nesting](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1305337)<br/>


#### Proposal
- What data did you choose to collect?<br/>
  Objects in the shape of circle that I touch/use every day, as well as their diameter, color, usability, how long have I used it.

- How did you collect it, what was the routine?<br/>
  I take a picture every time I see such objects, and at night at a specific time, I would input the objects as well as their attributes one by one in Google Form.

- Why did you choose to visualize the data in this way?
- What can be seen in the visualization? Does it reveal something you didn't expect?
- Did you make crucial compromises? Which ones?
- If this project had a larger scaler and wasn't designed for print, how would you imagine it to be?

#### Timeline
- Week 3: Collect Data, First coding draft
- Spring Festival: Collect Data (this will contrast great with data collect during school time), Coding
- Week 4: Collect Data (Only if needed), Resolve coding questions
- Week 5: Final Coding
- Week 6: Presentation
*Due Monday, Mar 8*

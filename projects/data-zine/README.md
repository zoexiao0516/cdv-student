# Data Zine Project

#### Inspirations
[Dear Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PTTTbewj2zsqgztBhNZKB2ipunpI7jiok2tmm_kfhXE/edit#gid=0) by Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec

#### Proposal
- What data did you choose to collect?
- How did you collect it, was was the routine?
- Why did you choose to visualize the data in this way?
- What can be seen in the visualization? Does it reveal something you didn't expect?
- Did you make crucial compromises? Which ones?
- If this project had a larger scaler and wasn't designed for print, how would you imagine it to be?

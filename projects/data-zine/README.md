#### Difficulty
1. Draw clearer boundaries for what kind of data goes into my data collection
1. Cluster datapoints into the same category, and avoid collision

#### Proposal
- *What data did you choose to collect?*<br/>
  Round-shaped food that I ate in the past two weeks, as well as their diameter, category, my fondness of them, how many times I ate them (frequencies), and a bunch of boolean attributes (if it is a Chinese specialty, if it is healthy, if I usually eat a lot of them in one go, if it is cooked).

- *How did you collect it, what was the routine?*<br/>
  I put it in notepad every time I ate something like this, then I input the data points into Google Form and convert them into json file.

- *Why did you choose to visualize the data in this way?*<br/>
All of the attributes mentioned above.

- *What can be seen in the visualization? Does it reveal something you didn't expect?*<br/>

- *Did you make crucial compromises? Which ones?*<br/>
Yes, I did. I was originally recording round objects I "use" everyday, but after discussion with Leon, I realize there is a limitless amount of items in this list.

- *If this project had a larger scaler and wasn't designed for print, how would you imagine it to be?*

#### Timeline
- Week 3: Collect Data, First coding draft
- Spring Festival: Collect Data (this will contrast great with data collect during school time), Coding
- Week 4: Collect Data (Only if needed), Resolve coding questions
- Week 5: Final Coding
- Week 6: Presentation
*Due Monday, Mar 8*
